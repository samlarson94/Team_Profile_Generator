# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This app can be utilized to create a Team Profile html page.  Built off of Node.js, it utilizes the inquirer npm package to collect user information using a series of prompts.  Once the user input has been collected, it updates an index.html file to allow the user to visually see an overview of their team.

- 'npm init -y'
- 'npm install jest'
- 'npm install inquirer'
